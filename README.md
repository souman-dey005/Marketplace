# NFT Marketplace DApp

## Project Description

The NFT Marketplace DApp is a decentralized platform built on Ethereum that enables users to buy, sell, and trade Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in a trustless, peer-to-peer manner. This smart contract provides a secure and efficient marketplace where NFT owners can list their digital assets for sale, and buyers can purchase them using Ether (ETH).

The marketplace operates without intermediaries, ensuring that transactions are transparent, immutable, and censorship-resistant. All marketplace activities are recorded on the blockchain, providing a permanent audit trail of ownership transfers and sales history.
